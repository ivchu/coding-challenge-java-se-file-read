## Assumptions

1. The program reads, analyzes data from a file and prints results to the console. Therefore, we will package it as a Java executable JAR for simplicity.
2. Users, presumably managers, are expected to have Java pre-installed on their systems. Docker packaging is deemed unnecessary, given that Java installation is under the purview of IT administration.
3. Maven is used solely for dependency management and as a build tool considering the application's simplicity. The build result should be a self-contained executable JAR file that can run on any system with Java installed.
4. The object count of maximum 1000 employees is reasonably manageable for Java runtime. Thus, we haven't considered splitting files or other approaches to decrease memory usage. 
5. If a manager's salary is lower than the expected range, we assume that the manager should get a salary increase up to the lower limit of the acceptable range (i.e., 20% more than the average of their subordinates' salaries). Similarly, if the manager's salary is higher than the acceptable range, it is compared with the upper limit of the range (i.e., 50% more than the average of their subordinates' salaries). 
6. Every 'Employee', except the CEO, is assumed to have a 'manager'. 
7. The CSV file format and column order are assumed to be standard; hence a sophisticated CSV reader is not necessary. 
8. If a manager has only one subordinate, the manager's salary will still be compared to the subordinate's. 
9. The CEO counts as a manager in the reporting line definition. A reporting line length of more than four levels (CEO inclusive) is considered too long. 
10. It's acceptable for a manager to earn exactly 20% more, and up to 50% more than the average salary of their direct subordinates. 
11. Over-optimization for execution isn't necessary given the maximum file size of 1000 lines, and the entire data can reside in program's memory. The program will fail if the file size is too large, avoiding the need for explicit line count validation. 
12. There's no requirement for fancy data output; hence, intricate formats and data rounding are unnecessary. 
13. A Dependency Injection framework is not necessary; hence it's not implemented. 
14. Given Mockito is not explicitly mentioned in the requirements, it's assumed to be prohibited. Mocking isn't implemented to keep the tests simple. In a real-life project scenario, Mockito or a similar framework would be used. 
15. There are no requirements governing the precision of calculations, hence a precision of four decimal places has been used. 
16. Logging will be kept minimalistic - only at debug level, mostly to avoid overwhelming the console with log data. Logging to a file can be introduced if required. 
17. The project currently adheres to SOLID principles. However, there is still potential to further enhance the application's SOLID compliance. Considering the KISS principle and the unclear future expansion scope of the project, it's decided not to overcomplicate the codebase unnecessarily. As the project evolves, additional considerations for further extension points and better class responsibility division can always be introduced. 
18. Since there's no dictate on record order, we will first read the entire data, then create a tree of employees. 
19. A valid file input is always expected. Implementing a comprehensive file validation would be laborious and is considered out of the scope for this project.

P.S. While there are opportunities for further refining tests and improving code quality, certain constraints including tight timelines and lack of a code review process may limit these improvements in the current phase. I welcome any feedback and suggestions for improvement, and I am committed to ongoing learning and betterment of the work.
